# Markdown Previewer

A web application that simulates a simple calculator. It is built with React, JavaScript, and CSS/HTML. It's the [fourth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) for the front end libraries certification (freecodecamp.org).

I've taken some liberties from the original brief.
